## Agile Methodology in Project Development

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

In developing Remote Forge, I've embraced agile methodology to ensure flexibility, continuous improvement, and responsiveness to user feedback. This approach allows me to quickly adapt to changes and prioritize tasks effectively, focusing on delivering value at every stage of development.

To manage the project efficiently, I utilize GitHub Issues and Projects alongside a Kanban board. This setup is crucial for organizing my workflow and keeping track of progress.

My Approach Using GitHub: Epics and User Stories: I break down the development into Epics and User Stories, making the project manageable and ensuring each feature closely aligns with user needs, such as enabling talents to discover remote jobs and employers to manage job listings.

Kanban Board: My Kanban board features columns for Backlog, In Progress, Paused/on Hold, Verification/Testing and Done, offering a clear visual guide to the project's status and allowing me to efficiently manage tasks from conception to completion.

Collaboration and Transparency: Even as a solo developer, GitHub fosters a transparent approach to project management, making it easier to track progress and adjustments needed throughout the development process.

Feedback Loop: Leveraging agile principles, I incorporate user feedback directly into the development cycle, using GitHub to track and address feedback related to specific User Stories or Epics, ensuring Remote Forge evolves in response to real user needs.

By adopting agile methodology and utilizing GitHub's robust project management tools, I navigate the development of Remote Forge with agility, keeping the project aligned with its core mission of connecting the remote work community.

## Five Planes of UX

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

The 5 Planes of User Experience (UX) provide a framework for understanding the layers involved in creating a user-centered design. This model, conceptualized by Jesse James Garrett in his book "The Elements of User Experience," outlines how UX designers can move from abstract to concrete in the process of designing digital products. Hereâ€™s how these planes can be applied to the development of Remote Forge:

1. Strategy Plane

- User Needs: For Remote Forge, understanding the needs of two primary user groupsâ€”Talents seeking remote work and Employers looking to hire remote talentâ€”is crucial. Talents desire easy access to job listings, straightforward application processes, and the ability to showcase their skills. Employers need to efficiently post jobs, manage applications, and find suitable candidates.
- Site Objectives: The main objective is to create a platform that facilitates the connection between remote job seekers and employers, offering a streamlined experience for both parties to find and fill remote work opportunities.

2. Scope Plane

- Functional Specifications: Key functionalities include user registration and authentication, job listing creation and management by Employers, profile creation and job application for Talents, and search and filter capabilities for job listings.
- Content Requirements: Content such as job descriptions, company profiles, talent bios, educational articles on remote work, and FAQs will be developed to engage users and provide valuable resources.

3. Structure Plane

- Interaction Design: The interaction design will focus on how users interact with Remote Forge, including navigating the site, filling out forms, and managing profiles or job listings. The goal is to ensure intuitive, seamless interactions that guide users through their journey on the platform.
- Information Architecture: The information architecture will organize and structure content and functionalities in a way that makes sense to the users, ensuring they can find information and perform tasks with ease.

4. Skeleton Plane

- Interface Design: This involves designing the layout of web pages and user interfaces for Remote Forge, ensuring that elements such as buttons, forms, and navigation menus are laid out in a user-friendly manner. Navigation Design: The navigation system will be designed to allow users to easily move between different parts of the site, with clear labels and logical grouping of site sections.
- Information Design: The presentation of information, such as job listings and profiles, will be structured for clarity and ease of understanding, making use of headings, lists, and visual cues to guide the userâ€™s eye.

5. Surface Plane

- Visual Design: The final layer involves choosing colors, typography, and imagery that align with the Remote Forge brand and appeal to the target audience. The visual design will enhance the usability of the platform while making it aesthetically pleasing, aiming to create a positive first impression and engaging user experience.

## Wireframes

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

For the initial design phase of Remote Forge, I used Figma to create the wireframes. Figma's versatility makes it ideal for developing both wireframes and mockups in the same environment. In this section, I'll showcase the wireframes that laid the groundwork for all key pages of the platform.

## Mockups

Building on the foundational wireframes, I progressed to designing detailed mockups for Remote Forge using Figma. These mockups are refined visual representations of the website, incorporating color schemes, typography, and imagery to bring the initial wireframe structures to life.

## Database Design

In the development of Remote Forge, I have meticulously crafted the database architecture to support a dynamic and scalable user model. To accommodate various user roles, I introduced a user_type field in the user model. This flexibility allows me to define distinct profiles and functionalities for different user types, initially implementing two primary roles: Talent and Employer.

Employers have the capability to create job listings, forming the core interaction of the platform. Each listing is directly linked to an employer, facilitating a streamlined management process. On the other side, Talents, equipped with comprehensive profile features including resumes and social links, can present a detailed professional persona.
